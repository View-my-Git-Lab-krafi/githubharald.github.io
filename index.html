			<h1>Welcome</h1>
			<p>
				My name is Harald Scheidl.
				I'm interested in computer vision, deep learning, C++ and Python.
				On this page I show:
			<ul>
				<li>Code I developed for my thesis. I open-sourced most of the Python code, while keeping C++ and GPU
					code mostly closed-source.</li>
				<li>Small personal computer vision projects that I open-sourced.</li>
				<li>Thesis on handwritten text recognition and a paper about a novel CTC decoding algorithm.</li>
				<li>Articles published about text recognition. These are mostly polished-up notes I made while writing my thesis.</li>
				<li>Sometimes, scientific articles leave out "obvious" steps in their derivations.
					In that cases I had to figure out myself these missing steps.
					Some of the articles arose because I though my notes could also be beneficial to others.
				</li>
			</ul>

			If you want to contact me, here is my e-mail:
